We hope this resource makes\r\nconversations about open scholarship more accessible, and acts as a\r\nuseful resource for students and educators. Over 100 scholars\r\ncontributed to the project; writing and editing descriptions, and\r\ngenerating a consensus for over 250 terms relating to open\r\nscholarship.\r\nIn February 2022 we published a paper describing the project in\r\nNature Human Behaviour (publishers link to accessible version: https://rdcu.be/cHsqM, and\r\npost-print: https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/kdqcw). Now, I cannot\r\nstress this enough: the paper is not the glossary. The paper describes\r\nand advertises the project, while the actual resource is completely open\r\n(and still open for contributions) on the FORRT website (https://forrt.org/glossary/).\r\nUnfortunately, the “official” version of the paper - the DOI’d\r\nversion - is behind a paywall (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01269-4).\r\nBefore you gasp and complain (as some have, but we’ll get to that\r\nshortly), know that we were informed only at the last minute that the\r\npaper would not be made open access. Technically the paper is a comment,\r\nand therefore deemed ineligible per journal policies to be open access.\r\nThere were long drawn out battles behind the scenes to make this open\r\naccess, that in the end we lost. What we were given was a publishers\r\naccess link we could openly share. Not technically open access, but at\r\nleast we could share that, and the postprint.\r\nThe complaints / concerns /\r\ngripes\r\nOnce again, someone on twitter has raised concern with the Nature\r\nHuman Behavior paper describing phase 1 of the FORRT glossary project.\r\nThis post isn’t necessarily a direct response to any specific message.\r\nBut the latest message did prompt me to write this, particularly as it\r\nfelt unnecessary to add a complaint about this project after\r\ncomplementing Flavio Azevedo (https://twitter.com/Flavio_Azevedo_) on his wonderful\r\nNASA interview (https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science/stories/dr-flavio-azevedo).\r\nSeveral co-authors and I have responded to these and other concerns\r\nabout the project since it was published. I cant say for others, but I\r\ncan imagine a sense of disappointment that this mass community effort\r\ncan be so quickly dismissed or critiqued out of hand.\r\nMostly at this point I’m just bored of cycling through very similar\r\nconversations, so I’m spending my morning writing this post. Honestly,\r\nI’m not sure I’ll engage in some of these complaints any more other than\r\ngiving the link to this post. If I seem tired and a bit jaded, it’s\r\nbecause I am.\r\nOK, the complaints in a somewhat discussion format (perhaps\r\nover-emphasised).\r\n1.\r\nThe project looks great, but I cant believe something so useful would be\r\npaywalled.\r\nNo, it’s not. The project is on the website, and you can still\r\ncontribute (https://forrt.org/glossary/). The paper is merely a\r\nsummary of phase 1 of the project, and you can still access it\r\n(publishers link to accessible version: https://rdcu.be/cHsqM, and post-print: https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/kdqcw). We share these\r\naccessible versions everywhere, including the website, so the official\r\nDOI link can basically be ignored in favour of these (sorry, not sorry,\r\nNHB).\r\n2. But, but, the paper is\r\npaywalled!\r\nWe were told it would be open (shrug emoji). Then at the last minute,\r\nbecause of journal policy, it was not. More than a few people spent a\r\nlot of time trying to navigate this, but we were eventually denied.\r\nSorry if you’re still disappointed in that.\r\n3.\r\nHow can you say you support open scholarship if you published in a\r\nNature journal!?\r\nPersonally, I think that the glossary is more than a net benefit to\r\nacademia. I know Springer, El$evier, et al. are demon spawn sent to suck\r\nacademia dry. Did we feed the beast? Maybe, but they didn’t get any\r\nmoney from us and the accessible links are what we’re sharing.\r\nI’d rather not have to rely on journals at all, but can you genuinely\r\nsay that if we had “only” preprinted this paper that anywhere as many\r\npeople would have seen the glossary? Is NHB a venue that would lead to a\r\nhigher readership and likely credibility for the glossary? Probably, and\r\ngiven the sheer amount of papers and commentaries on open scholarship in\r\nthere, it seems like a good way to spread the word.\r\nNow, if this were a solo author perspective, I would have pulled it\r\nand submitted elsewhere. Or, more likely, preprinted and procrastinated\r\non submitting. But, this was a mass effort and I dont think subjecting\r\neveryone to an entirely different submission (and likely a major\r\nrevision of the comment) would have benefited anyone - including those\r\nwho may benefit from the glossary itself.\r\n4. Oh,\r\nso you just want the prestigue of a Nature journal.\r\nI want recognition for the 100+ contributors on this project. I want\r\nprojects like this, that would otherwise be purely powered by\r\nvolunteered labour, to be recognised. I want a way for those that\r\ncontributed on this, and other FORRT projects, to get credit for doing\r\nso. Does publishing in NHB maximise that, probably. Do I hate academic\r\n“prestige” in its many unjustified, gate-keeping, and inequitable\r\nawfulness. Yes. Do I recognise that publications, and especially\r\npublications in outlets like this can make a world of difference for a\r\ngrass-roots, largely ECR led initiative. Also yes. Does it somehow\r\nminimise the integrity of our contributors/coauthors or the glossary\r\nproject, I argue no.\r\n5.\r\nOh, so you support the current system of (exploitative) academic\r\npublishing?\r\nDo I want the entire system to change. Yes. I’d happily see journals\r\nas we currently see them die off and replaced entirely with something\r\nbetter and more equitable. Was a comment paper about our glossary\r\nproject the vehicle for systemic change, no.\r\nI’m fond of the buffet table approach to open scholarship (shout out\r\nto Kirstie Whitaker https://twitter.com/kirstie_j for introducing many\r\npeople to this idea). We can do great work and make impactful\r\ncontributions in some aspects of open scholarship, but does every\r\nproject have to live by the “ideal” principles of open scholarship (if\r\nfolk can even agree on what those would be)? There will always be trade\r\noffs, in this instance we wanted to maximise the credit and impact of\r\nthe glossary project as well as maximise the recognition for our\r\ncontributors.\r\n6.\r\nThe paper being paywalled at NHB makes me doubt your open science\r\nawareness.\r\nCool, you do you. Check out the above responses. Maybe check out the\r\nglossary itself too before bashing the contributors and their expertise?\r\nOtherwise I can easily say who looks the bigger jerk in this\r\nexchange?\r\n7. Your definition of\r\n[insert term] sucks!\r\nThe project is open. Add improvements, suggest alternatives. That’s\r\nhow it will improve.\r\n8. You didn’t\r\ndefine XYZ! (likely my special sub-domain)\r\nCool, see the above, you can add it yourself. We welcome contributors\r\nand their contributions.\r\n9.\r\nJust like many open science movements, the project’s authors are\r\ndominated by WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and\r\nDemocratic societies).\r\nI don’t have the numbers on this. We did open the project and\r\nadvertise widely. We are looking to begin translation projects to\r\nincrease the diversity, representation, and accessibility. It wont solve\r\nthis problem, but hopefully helps improve things.\r\n10. General negative\r\nhalf-baked thoughts\r\nStop, do better.\r\nEnd\r\nThank you to everyone that contributed, and continues to contribute,\r\nto the glossary project. It’s am awesome resource, and it will continue\r\nto improve. Y’all are amazing and you created something useful.\r\nTo those flinging critiques - I agree with some of your concerns, I’d\r\nprefer academia to simply be different too. I hope this post helps\r\nexplain some background and my own thoughts on these critiques. I can\r\nsay that my own perspectives should not be interpreted as reflecting the\r\nview of every contributor/coauthor. Still, there is a difference between\r\ncritiquing this work such that improvements can be made, and mindless\r\npoo flinging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Scientific articles contain way too many acronyms.",
    "author": [],
    "date": "2022-01-29",
    "categories": [],
    "contents": "\r\nSome acronyms are used so widely used that spelling them out is not needed. For example, ECR for Early Career Researcher. Or more field specific, such as RT for Response Time, or GWAS for Gene-Wide Association Study. Acronyms do run into trouble when they could indicate different concepts: e.g. does your ML mean Multi-Level? Machine Learning? Maximum Likelihood?\r\nMore often than not, using Too Many Acronyms (TMA) can make your writing harder to read.1\r\nA pithy example:\r\nMany writers use Too Many Acronyms (TMA). Two challenging sub types of TMA are Too Many Unusual (unfamiliar works too) Acronyms (TMUA) and Too Many Overlapping Acronyms (TMOA; Similar also works, but then we would use TMSA). When TMA (or TMUA) occurs, the writing is both Hard To Read (HTR) and Hard To Follow (HTF). Writing that is HTR makes individual sentences more difficult to parse, insofar as it requires the reader to employ more executive control (EC) and Working Memory (WM) to recall TMA in order to understand the sentence. A knock on effect is that the writing becomes HTF, i.e. the reader must continually check All the Acronyms (AtA1) and All the Abbreviations (AtA2) to ensure they are following the thread of the argument. If the reader is anything like me, eventually the acronym becomes separate to whatever it refers. Then the reader is reading many instances of FCT2A as just a string of characters that is somehow important. Reducing TMA (and especially TMUA and TMOA/TMSA) should help avoid both HTR and HTR writing, leaving readers with EC/WM solely for your arguments.\r\nWhy acronyms?\r\nInternet ramblings aside, I do see acronyms being overused. One of my regular comments as a peer reviewer is to remove at least one acronym from the text. No, not to be pedantic or because I have my favourite reviewer 2 comments. I truly find papers that use an excessive amount of acronyms harder to read and harder to follow. I see three broad reasons for using excessive acronyms:\r\nTo reduce the word count. Consider how many words you are saving, is that worth the additional challenge readers have? I’ve seen an acronyms used that would barely affect the word count. I bet there are filler words that could be removed instead.\r\nTo try to make things easier to read by not repeating the same key phrase many, many times. This is one of the times I can get behind a paper-specific acronym. But, consider asking someone to read the same few paragraphs with and without the acronyms, I’d wager that the paragraphs without are easier to read and understand.\r\nTo signify that the term is key to the paper. By ensuring the reader has to spend extra energy remembering the acronym, you try to get them to keep this key concept in mind. Great, until you’re 5 acronyms deep and in 2 paragraphs the reader has forgotten most of them.\r\nOf course, I’m just an Early Career Researcher2 rambling on my own website. So, of course these thoughts are not prescriptive, nor do I think they apply across all contexts. In the end, the readers are the judges. So, lets be as kind to them as possible.\r\n\r\nYes, sometimes acronyms are well used. And No, this is not at attempt to lash out at those that find them useful. It is an account of why relying on them can make things more challenging for the reader↩︎\r\nECR, if you will.↩︎\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nI grew to dislike Hugo Academic for building my website. To start this website, I thought I’d share some reflections on the transition to Distill.\r\nWhy does Hugo hate me?\r\nI loved it at first. Relatively easy to set up, nice formatting, works on Rmarkdown. Lots of positives. The documentation to get started is also pretty nice, and plenty of researchers have written their own tutorials.\r\nBut…\r\nSome months passed, and I needed to update papers. Nothing too problematic, but; copying a folder, entering all of the pieces of information, and finally completing new entries always took longer than I would like. Compare this to my CV in overleaf, I can add new presentations and papers in 30 seconds, easy.\r\nWorse, every time there was a non-trivial update to any of R, blogdown, Hugo, something with netlify, or some combination of the way these things interact tended to break everything. Not to mention the transition to wowchemy. Every time this happened, the “easiest” thing to do was to rebuild the entire site. In for a 10 minute update, out for hours of frustrations.\r\nRebuilding the site was a) not fun, b) time consuming, and c) misses my main goal of having an easily update-able website. I want to make changes, build the site, and then push to github. I want to not enter rage every time.\r\nI almost remade it again recently. I’m glad I searched for alternatives and, luckily, spotted a few nice website/blogs. They used distill\r\nDistill is less complicated\r\nOne of the first things I read was that there were fewer dependencies on other things, including, including themes, hugo, and netlify. I put together this fairly simple site, and I lije it so far.\r\nI still slightly prefer the Hugo Academic theme, but a simpler theme for less hassle is more than worth it. Personally, I’m liking that I can link my CV and not feel compelled to add every poster and presentation I have given to the website itself (not that you cant, but because it’s not there by default you dont feel bad about not doing so)\r\nA few tips I came across or learned:\r\nadd the following to your theme.css file to use academic icons: @import url('https://cdn.rawgit.com/jpswalsh/academicons/master/css/academicons.min.css'); You can then call the icons with something like the following (remember to replace the fab and fa with ai): <i class=\"ai ai-osf\"><\/i>\r\nyou can add a few themes with postcards, I kind of like not having too many options. You can do way more with css and html, but I want simplicity and efficiency in my life at the moment.\r\nAdding altmertic badges is pretty easy, you can just add something like the following, copied from the altmetric website <div data-badge-type=\"donut\" data-doi=\"10.21105/joss.03041\" data-hide-no-mentions=\"true\" class=\"altmetric-embed\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, you’ll likely also need to add the following so that it works (from here)\r\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js'><\/script>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
