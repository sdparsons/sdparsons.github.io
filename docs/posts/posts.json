    "contents": "\r\nSome acronyms are used so widely used that spelling them out is not needed. For example, ECR for Early Career Researcher. Or more field specific, such as RT for Response Time, or GWAS for Gene-Wide Association Study. Acronyms do run into trouble when they could indicate different concepts: e.g. does your ML mean Multi-Level? Machine Learning? Maximum Likelihood?\r\nMore often than not, using Too Many Acronyms (TMA) can make your writing harder to read.1\r\nA pithy example:\r\nMany writers use Too Many Acronyms (TMA). Two challenging sub types of TMA are Too Many Unusual (unfamiliar works too) Acronyms (TMUA) and Too Many Overlapping Acronyms (TMOA; Similar also works, but then we would use TMSA). When TMA (or TMUA) occurs, the writing is both Hard To Read (HTR) and Hard To Follow (HTF). Writing that is HTR makes individual sentences more difficult to parse, insofar as it requires the reader to employ more executive control (EC) and Working Memory (WM) to recall TMA in order to understand the sentence. A knock on effect is that the writing becomes HTF, i.e. the reader must continually check All the Acronyms (AtA1) and All the Abbreviations (AtA2) to ensure they are following the thread of the argument. If the reader is anything like me, eventually the acronym becomes separate to whatever it refers. Then the reader is reading many instances of FCT2A as just a string of characters that is somehow important. Reducing TMA (and especially TMUA and TMOA/TMSA) should help avoid both HTR and HTR writing, leaving readers with EC/WM solely for your arguments.\r\nWhy acronyms?\r\nInternet ramblings aside, I do see acronyms being overused. One of my regular comments as a peer reviewer is to remove at least one acronym from the text. No, not to be pedantic or because I have my favourite reviewer 2 comments. I truly find papers that use an excessive amount of acronyms harder to read and harder to follow. I see three broad reasons for using excessive acronyms:\r\nTo reduce the word count. Consider how many words you are saving, is that worth the additional challenge readers have? I’ve seen an acronyms used that would barely affect the word count. I bet there are filler words that could be removed instead.\r\nTo try to make things easier to read by not repeating the same key phrase many, many times. This is one of the times I can get behind a paper-specific acronym. But, consider asking someone to read the same few paragraphs with and without the acronyms, I’d wager that the paragraphs without are easier to read and understand.\r\nTo signify that the term is key to the paper. By ensuring the reader has to spend extra energy remembering the acronym, you try to get them to keep this key concept in mind. Great, until you’re 5 acronyms deep and in 2 paragraphs the reader has forgotten most of them.\r\nOf course, I’m just an Early Career Researcher2 rambling on my own website. So, of course these thoughts are not prescriptive, nor do I think they apply across all contexts. In the end, the readers are the judges. So, lets be as kind to them as possible.\r\n\r\nYes, sometimes acronyms are well used. And No, this is not at attempt to lash out at those that find them useful. It is an account of why relying on them can make things more challenging for the reader↩︎\r\nECR, if you will.↩︎\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nI grew to dislike Hugo Academic for building my website. To start this website, I thought I’d share some reflections on the transition to Distill.\r\nWhy does Hugo hate me?\r\nI loved it at first. Relatively easy to set up, nice formatting, works on Rmarkdown. Lots of positives. The documentation to get started is also pretty nice, and plenty of researchers have written their own tutorials.\r\nBut…\r\nSome months passed, and I needed to update papers. Nothing too problematic, but; copying a folder, entering all of the pieces of information, and finally completing new entries always took longer than I would like. Compare this to my CV in overleaf, I can add new presentations and papers in 30 seconds, easy.\r\nWorse, every time there was a non-trivial update to any of R, blogdown, Hugo, something with netlify, or some combination of the way these things interact tended to break everything. Not to mention the transition to wowchemy. Every time this happened, the “easiest” thing to do was to rebuild the entire site. In for a 10 minute update, out for hours of frustrations.\r\nRebuilding the site was a) not fun, b) time consuming, and c) misses my main goal of having an easily update-able website. I want to make changes, build the site, and then push to github. I want to not enter rage every time.\r\nI almost remade it again recently. I’m glad I searched for alternatives and, luckily, spotted a few nice website/blogs. They used distill\r\nDistill is less complicated\r\nOne of the first things I read was that there were fewer dependencies on other things, including, including themes, hugo, and netlify. I put together this fairly simple site, and I lije it so far.\r\nI still slightly prefer the Hugo Academic theme, but a simpler theme for less hassle is more than worth it. Personally, I’m liking that I can link my CV and not feel compelled to add every poster and presentation I have given to the website itself (not that you cant, but because it’s not there by default you dont feel bad about not doing so)\r\nA few tips I came across or learned:\r\nadd the following to your theme.css file to use academic icons: @import url('https://cdn.rawgit.com/jpswalsh/academicons/master/css/academicons.min.css'); You can then call the icons with something like the following (remember to replace the fab and fa with ai): <i class=\"ai ai-osf\"><\/i>\r\nyou can add a few themes with postcards, I kind of like not having too many options. You can do way more with css and html, but I want simplicity and efficiency in my life at the moment.\r\nAdding altmertic badges is pretty easy, you can just add something like the following, copied from the altmetric website <div data-badge-type=\"donut\" data-doi=\"10.21105/joss.03041\" data-hide-no-mentions=\"true\" class=\"altmetric-embed\"><\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, you’ll likely also need to add the following so that it works (from here)\r\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js'><\/script>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
