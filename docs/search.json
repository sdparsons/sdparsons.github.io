I work in the Lifespan Cognitive Dynamics Lab based at the Donders Institute. I did my DPhil in Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford1\r\n              My current work is focused on the reliability of longitudinal structural brain imaging data across brain regions, structural measures, and studies. My aim is to support developmental cognitive neuroscience study changes in brain structure and function by focusing on sources of reliability and error. My core approach will be based on intra-class effect decomposition, closely tied to generalisability theory. These models extract sources of variation in order to explore where the variation/error comes from in the model, moving beyond a single metric of reliability (e.g. ICC for test-retest). I believe it is important to support others who may want to use these approaches, so I will be dedicating time to share code and develop tutorials.\r\n              I am happy to be contacted to discuss reliability of cognitive measures - particularly if you have questions about my splithalf package (see below) and need assistance with it.\r\n              Open Scholarship I try to do my own small bit for the improvement of psychological science and open scholarship. Amy Orben, Sophia Cruwell, and I co-founded the ReproducibiliTea Journal Clubs - now a large international community of Journal Clubs where folks talk about openness, reproducibility, and improving research practices. Flavio Azevedo and I also co-founded a Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT), a pedagogy-focused community working to support those seeking to incorporate open and reproducible practices into their teaching and mentoring.\r\n              Eventually, I will get around to loading my previous projects & talks here. In the meantime, I have most of my talk slides on the OSF, and you can check out my CV.
